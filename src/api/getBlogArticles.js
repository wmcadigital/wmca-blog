And to successfully achieve it was always going to rely on the public and the private sector working together.</p>\n<p>“So the agreement that we’re announcing with SSE, along with the appointment of E.ON as Coventry City Council’s strategic energy partner, is a significant moment - it sends out a clear message that the West Midlands is ready to collaborate with partners who can bring an array of experience, investment and insights.</p>\n<p>“Energy Capital was set up to provide the strategic vision and leadership on the energy infrastructure requirements for the whole of our region. This MOU is a fantastic opportunity to collaborate with one of the UK’s major energy companies to support the delivery of the infrastructure we need to reach our net zero vision and improve energy security over the months and years ahead.\"</p>\n<p>The WMCA has ambitious plans for the region to reach net zero by 2041 while also supporting economic growth and a fair and just transition.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wmca.org.uk/what-we-do/environment-and-energy/our-regional-energy-strategy/\">Regional Energy Strategy</a> – led by Energy Capital - explores how making the energy system more efficient and effective can help deliver those ambitions by ensuring that investment is properly directed to the places and communities served by that infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The West Midlands ground-breaking devolution deal, agreed with Government in March, also recognises the potential for the region to deliver net zero goals at a faster rate if it has the right responsibilities, powers and controls over funding.</p>\n<p>SSE is already working on delivering a number of green energy projects in the West Midlands and is creating a business hub in the region as part of its own energy strategy.</p>\n<p>Planned projects by SSE include the UK’s first HGV electric vehicle (EV) refuelling hub, a number of public ultra-rapid EV charging hubs and the design of a Future Energy System in East Birmingham. There are also plans for the creation of modern heat networks, large solar arrays and the installation of energy storage facilities.</p>\n<p>Neil Kirkby, managing director at SSE Energy Solutions, said: “At SSE we want to become the leading net zero infrastructure advisor to local government and local businesses and this MOU with the West Midlands Combined Authority is another example of our ambitions in this area.</p>\n<p>“We believe strongly in a just and fair transition to net zero and our new Social Value strategy will drive that forward. Decarbonising the country presents opportunities to support communities with regeneration, economic investment, and the creation of sustainable, long-term jobs.”</p>\n<p>The Energy Capital Conference took place at the Manufacturing Technology Centre in Coventry and was attended by 130 delegates from industry, regional businesses and local energy experts.</p>\n<p>Among the speakers was Cllr John Cotton, the WMCA’s portfolio lead for environment and energy, and leader of Birmingham City Council, who reinforced the importance of the private sector at regional and national level and public sector partners working together to overcome challenges around retrofit, transport decarbonisation, and energy security.</p>\n<p>Find out more about the WMCA’s energy programme of work on the WMCA <a href=\"http://www.wmca.org.uk/what-we-do/environment-and-energy\">website</a>.</p>"

The buses produce zero carbon emissions at the tailpipe and are powered by renewable ‘green’ energy thanks to solar panels, a second-life battery and charge-point infrastructure all installed at National Express Coventry’s bus depot by electrification specialist Zenobē. The electric buses take four hours to charge and can run for up to 175 miles depending on the time of year.",

In 2021 Transport for West Midlands (TfWM), which is part of the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA), secured £50 million funding from the Department of Transport to ensure every bus in Coventry is zero-emission. Funding was used to replace the city’s bus fleet with zero-emission electric buses along with charging infrastructure.<br><br>The latest 130 vehicles are in addition to 10 fully electric double-decker buses introduced by National Express Coventry in 2020, supported by £2.2 million of government funding from the Ultra-Low Emission Bus Scheme.<br><br>With 80 percent of National Express Coventry’s fleet now zero-emission, it marks a significant step forward in Coventry’s mission to promote sustainable transportation and create a healthier environment for the community. It also comes after the completion of 1250 electric vehicle charging sockets in Coventry, contributing to the ongoing improvement of the city's air quality.</p>"

University College Birmingham, WMG at the University of Warwick, Cranfield University and RAVMAC LTD will jointly deliver the project with the support of project partners including Jaguar Land Rover, which starts in October 2023 and runs over 18 months.</p>\n<p>Rosa Wells, Executive Dean of the School of Engineering, Digital & Sustainable Construction at University College Birmingham and Project Lead, said: “This project is vital in supporting our region as well as contributing towards the wider net zero ambitions. As a University that develops and delivers education from level 1 through to level 7 (postgraduate) we are in a unique position to lead this project, providing a sustainable training model that meets the needs of learners, employers, wider industry and our region”</p>\n<p>The programme will offer an ambitious blend of traditional physical training alongside advanced immersive digital technologies such as augmented, virtual and mixed reality. Learners will be taught skills used across battery manufacturing, repairing, recycling and reusing that will support them in roles such as technicians, production, maintenance, engineering and quality assurance.</p>\n<p>Mark McNally, Technical Director at RAVMAC Ltd said:</p>\n<p>“This project builds on established leading regional technical expertise and capabilities, and the use of our digital learning environments will be core to the design of the training programme, enabling learners to navigate the whole battery manufacturing process in a safe and structured manner.”</p>\n<p>As part of the DEBUT-WM training programme, the partners will target industry organisations, functions and individuals directly involved in battery workforce capability development. This will ensure that the ongoing delivery of the programme is actively informed by stakeholders and ensures wider sharing of the project outcomes and learning.</p>\n<p>The programme will also utilise equipment and resources from WMG which is currently used in cutting-edge research in battery manufacturing and the wider electrification revolution. The project will be aligned to the broader <a href=\"https://hvm.catapult.org.uk/reports/national-electrification-skills-framework/\">National Electrification Skills Framework</a> spearheaded by WMG ensuring that learners acquire essential skills in electrification systems.</p>\n<p>Professor Robin Clark, Dean of WMG said:</p>\n<p>“Up to 91% of all automotive manufacturing roles require some electrification training and the electrification revolution is expanding at pace to sectors such as rail and aerospace. With up to 80% of the workforce of 2035 already in work, the filling of electrification roles will depend on us delivering higher level skills through training programmes such as DEBUT-WM.”</p>\n<p>The West Midlands Combined Authority is facilitating the Electrification Taskforce in the West Midlands. The WMCA is prioritising increasing level 3 training in the region, accelerated training routes that respond to changing business needs, increasing flexibly delivered training, supporting increases in workers accessing training and qualifications, championing equality and diversity in the region’s workforce, and working towards the net zero agenda.</p>\n<p>Andy Street, Mayor of the West Midlands and WMCA Chair, said: “This is a project with tremendous potential - supporting our region’s priorities whilst ensuring local people have the skills they need to succeed and secure high quality job opportunities in the months and years ahead. Together, we can offer the chance for residents to up-skill in preparation for the jobs and economy of the future.”</p>\n<p>DEBUT-WM has established the Battery Training Advisory Group (BTAG) to input into the ongoing development, delivery and future of the programme. The project support partnership are: University College Birmingham, WMG, Cranfield University, RAVMAC LTD, Jaguar Land Rover, Microsoft, Manufacturing Technology Centre, Delta Cosworth, West Midlands Combined Authority and the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Institute of Technology.</p>\n<p>Find out more about training opportunities and our work with industry at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ucb.ac.uk/about-us/schools/department-of-engineering/\">Department of Engineering | University College Birmingham (ucb.ac.uk)</a></p>"
